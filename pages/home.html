                    <h2>I'm currently a Software Engineer at Amazon.</h2>
                    <p>
                        I love to build things! In the last ten years I've worked on a lot of projects...
                        automated teller machines, school bus routing, field trip planning,
                        and most recently large scale applications and web services using AWS technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a full-stack developer with a preference to work on the back-end,
                        optimizing algorithms and implementing awesome design patterns.
                        Through my open communication style, hard work ethic, and relentless
                        focus on driving best practices, I earn the trust of my team and colleagues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my spare time, I've built game engines, Android apps, and lately I have
                        been experimenting with using Raspberry Pi Pico's for home automation projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whenever I've wanted a program to do something that doesn't exist, I build it.
                    </p>
